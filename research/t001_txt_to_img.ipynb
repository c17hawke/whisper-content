So let's get started here and let's first of all go to the code that we have written for this in the Jupyter notebook. So you can see that here we had two instead of having one file upload we had two and then we had text prompt as well and yeah that's it. So you can if you can remember so you can see that here we have two images one text prompt and that n value that is how many variations you want and as well as the size. So if you compare with the previous two examples so one had just prompt another one had images okay only image and then variations previous one has a text and then it's variation so it's a combination of both you can see here. So what we can do is we can borrow some of these learnings from the previous two pages that we have created and we will create our fourth page right?
